# What is `georchestra/mapstore`

**Mapstore** is a module for geOrchestra which offers
- an highly modular Open Source WebGIS framework to create, manage and securely share maps and mashups.



# How to use this image

As for every other geOrchestra webapp, its configuration resides in the data directory ([datadir](https://github.com/georchestra/datadir)), typically something like /etc/georchestra, where it expects to find a mapstore sub-directory.

It is recommended to use the official docker composition: https://github.com/georchestra/docker.

For this specific component, see the section `mapstore` in the [`georchestra/docker/docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/georchestra/docker/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file.
